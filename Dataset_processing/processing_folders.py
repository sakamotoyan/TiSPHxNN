    numbering is continuous and consistent across all folders.

    input_folder_path (str): The base directory containing the folders with the datasets.
    folder_list (list of str): A list of folder names, in the order in which they should be processed.
    attr_name_list (list of str): A list of attribute names to be used for filtering and renaming files.
    output_folder_path (str): The directory where the concatenated and renamed files will be saved.

    The function copies files from each folder in folder_list, renames them based on their attribute name
    and a continuous numbering scheme, and then saves these files in output_folder_path.

    Note:
    - Assumes file names are in the format '{attribute_name}_{number}.npy'.
    - The directories specified in input_folder_path and output_folder_path should exist.
    - The function does not handle cases where the output folder already contains files with the same names
      as the renamed files, which may lead to overwriting.
